           <h2> <em>Carne asada is a Mexican dish featuring steak that's marinated in a lime juice and seasonings mixture. 
            It literally translates to "grilled meat," so the steak is traditionally grilled.</em> </h2>
    <br>
             <p>Making this carne asada marinade is so easy: Just combine all the ingredients in a bowl. 
                Reserve 1 cup of the marinade for use after the steak is cooked. 
                Then place the pounded out steak in the marinade and let it sit for 24 hours.</p>
            <p>This recipe calls for a 24 hour marination time, and we agree that 24 hours will produce the most flavorful and moist carne asada. 
                However, overnight, or even a few hours, in the marinade is better than nothing.</p>

                <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    <p>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine.</p>
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <p>Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p>Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade over top. Serve immediately.</p>
                </li>
